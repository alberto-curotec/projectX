# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Fixed custom task ID lookup using the correct ClickUp API endpoint (`/task/{custom_id}?custom_task_ids=true&team_id=...`) — previous version used a non-existent endpoint format

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Custom task IDs**: Entry rows now show the ClickUp custom ID (e.g. `CTK-1234`) instead of the internal numeric ID
- **Split time entry**: Entries ≥ 30 minutes show a ✂ Split button that expands an inline panel
  - Duration dropdown in 15-minute intervals (from 15 min up to duration − 15 min)
  - Task lookup by custom ID with live resolution showing task name for confirmation
  - Description, tags, and billable flag pre-populated from the original entry, fully editable
  - On save: reduces the original entry by the split amount and creates a new entry on the target task
  - Start/end times are adjusted so the new entry occupies the tail end of the original time block
  - Tags synced to the new entry via the ClickUp tags endpoint
  - Panel auto-refreshes after a successful split to show updated durations

### Changed
- `formatEntry` now includes `customId` (from `task.custom_id`) and `end` timestamp
- Entry meta badge displays custom ID when available, falls back to internal task ID

### Backend (Code.gs)
- New function `lookupTaskByCustomId(customId)` — resolves a custom task ID to `{ taskId, taskName, customId }` via the ClickUp task endpoint with `custom_task_ids=true`
- New function `splitTimeEntry(payload)` — orchestrates the split: fetches original entry, PUTs reduced duration, POSTs new entry on target task, syncs tags

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- Removed hardcoded `API_TOKEN` and `TEAM_ID` constants from `Code.gs`
- Credentials now read at runtime from a `Config` sheet in a separate Google Spreadsheet
- `SPREADSHEET_ID` remains in `Code.gs` as the only hardcoded value (not a secret — just a pointer)
- Config is cached per execution via `_config` so the spreadsheet is only read once per request, regardless of how many API calls are made
- Error messages now explicitly name which key is missing from the Config sheet (`CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` or `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`) to make misconfiguration easier to diagnose

### Config sheet format
| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| CLICKUP_API_TOKEN | pk_xxxxxxx |
| CLICKUP_TEAM_ID | xxxxxxx |

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` and `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID` moved out of `Code.gs` and into a `Config` sheet in a separate Google Spreadsheet
- `Code.gs` now only contains `SPREADSHEET_ID` — a non-secret pointer to where config lives
- `getConfig()` reads the Config sheet at runtime and caches the result for the duration of the execution, so the sheet is only hit once per request
- Error messages now tell you exactly which key is missing from the Config sheet if misconfigured
- Updated README setup instructions to reflect the Config sheet approach

- Favorites sorted to top of table; remaining developers sorted alphabetically

**Data**
- Fetches all time entries for the team from ClickUp `/team/{id}/time_entries` endpoint
